    <h2 class="w3-wide"><b>TIPS TO STAY MENTALLY HEALTHY</b></h2>
    <img src="images/tips1.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <p class="w3-justify">An important part of keeping fit and healthy is to take care of your own mental health. There are plenty of things you can do to help make sure you keep yourself mentally healthy.
    <ul>
      <li><u>Learn ways to manage stress.</u></li>
      You can’t avoid stress, so you need to learn how to manage it. This will help you stay calm and be able to function in stressful situations.
    </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><u>Eat well</u></li>
     Eating well isn't just important for our bodies, but it's also important for our minds. Certain mineral deficiencies, such as iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies, can give us a low mood. Try to eat a balanced diet. If you find you're a particularly stressed or anxious person, you should try limiting or cutting out caffeine as this can make you feel jittery and anxious.
    </ul>
     <ul>
      <li><u>Get plenty of sleep</u></li>
      Sleep is really important for our physical and mental health. Sleep helps to regulate the chemicals in our brain that transmit information. These chemicals are important in managing our moods and emotions. If we don't get enough sleep, we can start to feel depressed or anxious.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Do something you enjoy</u></li>
      Try to make time for doing the fun things you enjoy. If you like going for a walk, painting or a specific TV show, try to set aside time to enjoy yourself. If we don't spend any time doing things we enjoy, we can become irritable and unhappy.Whether you need help to get out and about or not take a look at our Things To Do section, or go to our Events calendar, for ideas and information on what is going on in your area.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Get plenty of sunlight</u></li>
      Sunlight is a great source of vitamin D. Vitamin D is a really important vitamin for our bodies and our brains. It helps our brains to release chemicals which improve our mood, like endorphins and serotonin. Try to go out in the sun when you can, but make sure you keep your skin and eyes safe. 30 minutes to two hours a day of sunlight is ideal. During the winter, some people become depressed because they aren't getting enough sunlight - this is known as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Some people find using a special light-therapy lamp helps to alleviate the symptoms.
